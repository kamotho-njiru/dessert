Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
total cost= {size + Crust + toppings}
Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
let total = 0, count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count += 1;
}
console.log(total);

Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.

$("button").click(function(){
    $("p").slideDown();
  });

  let delivery("optional")  

total cost =  pizza + deliver
If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
